Hello everyone, my name is Amanda. I am currently a psychology student based near the city of Basel. Alongside my academic pursuits, I find solace and joy in the art of crocheting, drawing, and gaming offers. I love good food and I am always to have for a good recommendation.  Additionally, I cherish the moments spent with friends over good food and games
